Created a data warehouse to monitor and analyze traffic data in the Bay Area. The warehouse integrates traffic, weather, and accident data. The Bay Area is heavily congested due to its dense population, which leads to high volumes of traffic and bottlenecking, leading the roads to be congested. Our data warehouse evaluates data from 2021-2023 traffic, weather, and accident datasets. By interpreting these three datasets together and forming a star schema, we were able to optimally query our data warehouse and generate insights into traffic patterns and the impact that weather has on the traffic and on possibly being a factor in accidents. By using data analytics and visualizations we can help the public transportation department make data-driven decisions on improving road safety and traffic flow.
